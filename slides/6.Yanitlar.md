|---------|----|----|
|Project goals can include functional requirements as well as quality requirements|x| |
|Architectural goals are derived from the quality requirements|x| |
|Business stakeholders should concentrate on business goals and not interfere with architectural goals| |x|
|To avoid conflicts, business goals and architectural goals should be non-overlapping sets| |x|

|Responsibilities|x| |
|Internal structure| |x|
|Implementation suggestions| |x|

### LG 2-6: Design Principles
**A-question**: What is the objective of the dependency inversion principle?
- [ ] Large components should not depend on small components
- [ ] Components should be able to create dependent components more easily
- [x] If possible, components should only depend on each other via interfaces

### LG 3-1: Quality Requirements
**P-question**: Your team is constructing an online eCommerce shop. Which are three most important properties of architecture documentation?
- [ ] All classes need to be contained in the documentation
- [x] The documentation must be current and up-to-date
- [x] The documentation should explain important architecture decisions

**K-question**: How are written and verbal communication variants related?
|Statement|True|False|
|---------|----|----|
|Verbal communication should complement written documentation|x| |
|Written documentation should always precede verbal communication| |x|
|Architects should decide on a variant and strictly follow this path| |x|

## Chapter 4: Software Architecture and Quality

### LG 4-1: Quality Models
**K-question**: Which pairs of quality attributes often conflict with each other?
|Pair|Conflicting|Not Conflicting|
|----|-----------|----------------|
|Runtime configurability and robustness|x| |
|Understandability and readability| |x|
|Security and legal compliance| |x|
|Usability and security|x| |

### LG 4-4: Quantitative Evaluation

## Chapter 5: Examples of Software Architecture

The example questions for Chapter 5 in the PDF focus more on practical understanding and implementation rather than specific multiple choice or evaluation questions. The emphasis is on understanding:
- The relationship between requirements and solution
- Technical implementation rationale
- Real-world application of architectural concepts

Note: Remember that this is not a complete collection of all questions from the PDF, but represents key examples for each chapter. For comprehensive exam preparation, you should review all exercise sections within each learning goal.
